- 👋 Hi, I’m @VieuxOnche, I used to code in COBOL (not that common I know ^^) and a bit of Python but I came back to my main domain of expertise : chemistry !
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to make fun projects and fun games for a small amount of people. I also want to challenge myself.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GDScript on par with C#
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing ATM.
- 📫 How to reach me (WIP).
